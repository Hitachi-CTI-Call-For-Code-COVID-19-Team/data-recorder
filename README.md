<center><img src="./img/datarecorder.jpg" width="50%" border="1" style="padding: 20px"></center>

- The data recorder, one of the back-end functions of the COVSAFE solution, runs on IBM Cloud Function.
- The main function of the data recorder is to store edge-side sensing data in a persistent database in the cloud. The data recorder streams edge-side sensor data by consuming topics in the IBM Cloud Event Stream, and stores the updates sequentially in the cloudant database.ã€€
    - The data recorder is triggered by a message trigger in Event Streams, gives a timestamp of the time the trigger was issued, and stores the triggered message count in bulk in the cloudant database, with one message and one document.
    - EventStream Topic: "**covsafe**"
    - Cloudant Database Name: "**z\_iotp\_o9ypqz\_default\_YYYY-MM-DD**"
        - YYYY: year, MM: Month, DD: date
